26/07/2017, 14:56 - AJ Anderson: You still for a catchup? what about Akva@7pm?  I've got yoga 6-7 😏🤙 and actually I quite enjoy a pint afterwards, with that said i'd miss it if that doesnt work for you

26/07/2017, 15:37 - AJ Anderson: Well. You're more important than yoga in any case. With that said we could do short 4pm pre yoga pint and drive over town together for 5.45 ish. Or bin girly yoga altogether, Or any combination of the above ;) am super easy lindso
26/07/2017, 15:31 - Lindsay Walker: Where is yoga? I could meet Meg at 8.30ish which would give us an hour somewhere? Not ideal but important to keep the yoga going...
26/07/2017, 15:44 - Lindsay Walker: I can't leave till 5 now (just got something else I have to do 😕), so I'd love it if you could forego the hot girls in yoga pants... your sacrifice would not go unnoticed!

15/03/2020, 15:44 - Lindsay Walker: Just outside
16/03/2020, 12:26 - AJ Anderson: What was the window for your help today?
16/03/2020, 12:27 - Lindsay Walker: Erm, earliest I could get to you would be 5
16/03/2020, 12:28 - AJ Anderson: Ah OK. No problem, let's cancel. The plasterer is actually in later than I thought
16/03/2020, 13:00 - Lindsay Walker: Ok, hope things work out
16/03/2020, 16:55 - AJ Anderson: I'm going to snow 7 tonight
16/03/2020, 16:55 - AJ Anderson: *Score
16/03/2020, 16:55 - Lindsay Walker: Yeah?
16/03/2020, 17:38 - AJ Anderson: Yeah. Think on that when you're choosing the teams
16/03/2020, 17:47 - Lindsay Walker: You are against me, so I will need to score 8 😂
23/03/2020, 08:49 - AJ Anderson: ⚽
23/03/2020, 08:49 - AJ Anderson: 😟☹️😒
23/03/2020, 08:49 - AJ Anderson: What is there to carry on for now!
23/03/2020, 09:07 - Lindsay Walker: Go running so that  you will amaze us all when footie is back?
23/03/2020, 22:02 - Lindsay Walker: Lockdown! Flipping heck. Hope all of you are ok, here to chat over the next few weeks if that helps; it will certainly help me!
26/04/2020, 16:02 - Lindsay Walker: Hey dude, how's it going?
18/05/2020, 00:11 - AJ Anderson: Doing OK linds. I'm out and proud covidiot by the way. So handshakes/coffees /footy/Bike rides/visits all ok with me.
18/05/2020, 00:12 - AJ Anderson: Just want to set out my stall. Wouldn't want anyone respecting my health/wellbeing unnecessarily.
18/05/2020, 00:12 - AJ Anderson: You doing OK?
18/05/2020, 00:12 - Lindsay Walker: 21 days mate, impressive reply time 😂
18/05/2020, 00:13 - Lindsay Walker: Not bad, sticking to the guidelines, as you would expect. Is your stance that there isn't a virus or just that you don't care if you get it?
18/05/2020, 00:14 - Lindsay Walker: I'm really missing seeing people, videochat is not the same!
18/05/2020, 00:15 - AJ Anderson: Well figured we've all got time on our hands. Got to spread out the excitement
18/05/2020, 00:15 - Lindsay Walker: Lol
18/05/2020, 00:15 - AJ Anderson: More or less. I'm pretty socially distant to start with
18/05/2020, 00:15 - Lindsay Walker: How's the flat?
18/05/2020, 00:15 - AJ Anderson: Yeah. Def agree there.
18/05/2020, 00:16 - AJ Anderson: IMG-20200502-WA0011.jpg (file attached)
18/05/2020, 00:16 - AJ Anderson: Getting there
18/05/2020, 00:16 - Lindsay Walker: Videochat without girls stripping obvs, that kind would still be good...
18/05/2020, 00:17 - Lindsay Walker: Nice! Looking good
18/05/2020, 00:17 - AJ Anderson: 🤣
18/05/2020, 00:18 - AJ Anderson: Yeah. So what level of adherence would you say you are?
18/05/2020, 11:22 - Lindsay Walker: Pretty strict so far, apthough might happen to be cycling in the same place as Sarah sometime this week
18/05/2020, 11:42 - AJ Anderson: im a huge cynic.  Im of the opinion that deep down people know how you do and don't catch a virus and that everything else is virtue signalling
18/05/2020, 11:46 - Lindsay Walker: It does differ between viruses though...
18/05/2020, 11:58 - AJ Anderson: True. I'd go as far as to say peoples attitude are more connected to individual lockdown situation and financial recompense than genuine care for others.
18/05/2020, 11:59 - AJ Anderson: hard line as ever 😅
18/05/2020, 11:59 - AJ Anderson: The genius of the governmental response is creating a situation where enough of the population is sufficiently content such that the rest fall in line with some public chiding and media led availability bias.
18/05/2020, 12:00 - AJ Anderson: needless to say im dying for a pint and game of footy with my old pal.
18/05/2020, 12:03 - Lindsay Walker: Lol. Do you think the figures are made up then? Or do you accept that the social distancing policy has saved lives, but just think it should be shaped by personal responsibility?
18/05/2020, 12:09 - AJ Anderson: The last one.
18/05/2020, 12:10 - AJ Anderson: If you can't handle covid then stay at home and we'll bring you shopping
18/05/2020, 12:10 - AJ Anderson: Or some sort of waiver to acknowledge that you accept death without nhs support should you catch it and not be able to handle it
18/05/2020, 12:11 - Lindsay Walker: So if you have it and don't know yet (because you have 5-14 days before symptoms) and spread it to others, should you be liable / feel guilty?
18/05/2020, 12:12 - Lindsay Walker: Or just thems the breaks?
18/05/2020, 12:13 - AJ Anderson: I think leaving the house is implied consent to facing the dangers associated with being alive.
18/05/2020, 12:15 - AJ Anderson: We'll got so much more great chat to have with some new material. I can't wait. You and Meg doing OK?
18/05/2020, 12:15 - Lindsay Walker: Although if you need to work, it is coerced consent...
18/05/2020, 12:16 - Lindsay Walker: Doing ok thanks, generally. We are not sick of each other yet, partially because we have three rooms 😂
18/05/2020, 12:20 - AJ Anderson: I have a basketball which I put in the same category as golf and tennis (kind of Fringe non contact) so if you're ever passing Dalmeny St, come and shoot some hoops with me
18/05/2020, 12:21 - Lindsay Walker: Lol, if we were in England I would
18/05/2020, 12:26 - AJ Anderson: Next week then. Nicola just does what Boris does but on a week delay so she can pretend like she's an independent law maker
18/05/2020, 12:27 - Lindsay Walker: Hahaha, our infection rate is currently a chunk higher than London, so it is legit to delay a bit . Nippy though...
18/05/2020, 12:28 - AJ Anderson: Take care Linds. Can't wait to hang out again!
18/05/2020, 12:29 - Lindsay Walker: Me too maye
18/05/2020, 12:29 - Lindsay Walker: *mate
18/05/2020, 12:29 - Lindsay Walker: Looking forward to a strong beer at Jerry's
20/05/2020, 21:03 - Lindsay Walker: So if I was out cycling somewhere tomorrow or Friday, what is the likelihood that you would be cycling in the same place? Potentially stopping to rehydrate in the sun with a beer...
20/05/2020, 22:03 - AJ Anderson: Mid to high likelihood I'd say
21/05/2020, 17:03 - Lindsay Walker: Crammond too far? Or Arthur's Seat?
21/05/2020, 17:23 - AJ Anderson: Nowheres too far

29/05/2020, 10:25 - AJ Anderson: Tbc.
29/05/2020, 10:39 - Lindsay Walker: Ok... did you guys fall out?
29/05/2020, 10:39 - AJ Anderson: Nothing more than the standard
29/05/2020, 10:39 - AJ Anderson: 😅
29/05/2020, 10:39 - Lindsay Walker: Lol
29/05/2020, 10:40 - AJ Anderson: Why do you think that?
29/05/2020, 10:42 - Lindsay Walker: She said you were hanging out last night. I thought it unlikely that you had a date due to lockdown. I considered that you might be bored of seeing one of us, but thought it unlikely. The next most logical option was that you may have fallen out.
29/05/2020, 10:43 - AJ Anderson: 🤣Beautiful.
29/05/2020, 10:45 - AJ Anderson: No just accounting to myself my time. Its my new covid thing. Dalmeny St needs finished once and for all and I'm a champion procrastinator
29/05/2020, 10:46 - Lindsay Walker: Ah. Focus your work today so you can stop at 4? Like, as if it was a job? 😂
29/05/2020, 10:48 - Lindsay Walker: Sorry for not considering that working might be what made you reluctant! 😳
29/05/2020, 14:46 - Lindsay Walker: How goes the graft?
29/05/2020, 17:04 - Lindsay Walker: Not sure if you have actually decided, or if you are just enjoying the bants. I can fully appreciate both. About to go and get some good beers, have marinaded pork and some burgers. But obviously up to you
29/05/2020, 17:05 - AJ Anderson: Maybe swing by later for one and a burger
29/05/2020, 17:05 - AJ Anderson: What's the arrangement?
29/05/2020, 17:05 - AJ Anderson: Don't tell nicola mind
29/05/2020, 17:07 - Lindsay Walker: I'm going to cycle over to QP pretty soon, enjoy the sun. How is the flat going today? Don't want to stop you if you are being productive, but if you are struggling I would urge you to come hang out. I need to be home by 8.30 for something else, so won't be there late
29/05/2020, 17:07 - Lindsay Walker: I'm counting you and Sarah as one household 😂 just to wind you both up, obvs.
29/05/2020, 17:08 - Lindsay Walker: If Nicola asks I mean

04/06/2020, 19:21 - Lindsay Walker: But forecast is 57%
04/06/2020, 19:21 - AJ Anderson: You've always been a risk taker
04/06/2020, 19:22 - AJ Anderson: I'd do a brolly lap of the queen's park
04/06/2020, 19:23 - Lindsay Walker: Hmmm. Can't cycle with a brolly. Maybe should try tomorrow?

28/06/2020, 12:59 - AJ Anderson: The ratio of weirdos to normal people is significantly higher.  And I don't mean to sound posh but I realised this morning I missed the sound of the sunday bells from st marys cath.
28/06/2020, 13:49 - Lindsay Walker: Understandable and agreed on the oddities ratio!
30/06/2020, 11:23 - Lindsay Walker: As you may have anticipated, the Whisky Fringe isn't going ahead in August. We have made a doodle poll with the options

11/08/2020, 23:26 - AJ Anderson: https://twitter.com/edinburgh/status/1292894720444727296?s=08
11/08/2020, 23:31 - Lindsay Walker: Ah, cool. Wonder if it will still go / went ahead
11/08/2020, 23:31 - AJ Anderson: Hope you're on the bus!
11/08/2020, 23:32 - Lindsay Walker: I am!
15/08/2020, 13:07 - AJ Anderson: 1.Offering ex-wife is a slight.
2. Metrics is genius. Tho I don't like being told that I'm losing points not gaining from here on in.
3. Thrilled about the house. I'm hopeful for you. I think that was a marriage compromise and I recognise (but not experienced ) that that must be a tough thing..."streets of baltimore" in reverse... Just not the outcome I hope 🤣
15/08/2020, 13:07 - AJ Anderson: Love spending time Linds... Like I always say... Always come away with some new angles
15/08/2020, 13:11 - Lindsay Walker: For 1, I understand your viewpoint, just don't think that is what he i tended

2 who says you are losung frim here? You are older, but that is better in some people's metrics. You are also wiser, potentially richer, better travelled etc etc

3 yeah, compromise is tough sometimes! Especially when the other person doesn't get why it is a big deal for you (can happen both ways!)
15/08/2020, 14:01 - AJ Anderson: If we're being brutally honest. Having been previously married reduces your metric.
15/08/2020, 14:01 - AJ Anderson: Same with kids
15/08/2020, 14:06 - AJ Anderson: Second time round the block is second choice. Its hardly the fairy tale
15/08/2020, 14:07 - Lindsay Walker: Those reduce people's value in *your* metric; the point is that metrics are individual
16/08/2020, 14:14 - AJ Anderson: yes and no. theres a bioligcal metric underpinning it all
16/08/2020, 14:45 - Lindsay Walker: Less so for chaps though; you *could* have kids 80...
16/08/2020, 15:49 - Lindsay Walker: At the zoo with our godson

21/03/2023, 12:28 - AJ Anderson: Aye he takes a huff. I think it might be arrogance mixed with low EQ. Arrogance because on the ball he's better than a lot of us. but beyond the playground it's teams that win games not glory hunters
21/03/2023, 12:30 - AJ Anderson: Haha yeah Tom. I've got a shortlist of names that makes my heart sink. I'll happily play against any of them but with is always character building (read managing inner regression to childhood 🤣)

20/04/2023, 13:24 - AJ Anderson: anyway. elevenlabs that puts our current status quo (alexa, google asst, bose speaker voices etc. to shame)
21/04/2023, 09:06 - Lindsay Walker: I've read down to point 8, at which point he became too banal to continue...
21/04/2023, 09:45 - AJ Anderson: haha ok, not my best recommend
21/04/2023, 09:45 - AJ Anderson: what do you fancy for lunch?
21/04/2023, 09:52 - Lindsay Walker: No, some of it was interesting and thought provoking, just that he maybe lost patience and started to just surface thought.
21/04/2023, 09:53 - Lindsay Walker: Something outside?
21/04/2023, 09:54 - AJ Anderson: is moloch referenced in the bible....or the torah? ...or neither

22/07/2023, 20:45 - AJ Anderson: I feel foolish and pathetic tho I'm fairly sure I'm not being as naive as she appears to be asserting. Regardless I'm in a pretty bad way and I'll look forward to your objective analysis
22/07/2023, 20:47 - AJ Anderson: Sober and measured as always in the face of the drama I seem to unintentionally embroil myself in
22/07/2023, 20:47 - Lindsay Walker: Dude, that really sucks
22/07/2023, 20:48 - AJ Anderson: I'm in a bar by myself

14/08/2023, 07:54 - AJ Anderson: spent the entire weekend alone in my apartment linds. Pretty grim.

14/08/2023, 07:55 - AJ Anderson: Early starts. And the morning yogaand and the porridge.
14/08/2023, 08:37 - AJ Anderson: Its really hard not to fall back into self-pity but from a really objective standpoint it is the ultimate social validation.  The premier league started up again at the weekend, saka had a cracking game against forrest - and all i can think is that this guy _can't_ go a full weekend without someone inviting him or asking him to do stuff, or having dinner plans.  Sure, its an edge case, but its a measure.
14/08/2023, 08:38 - AJ Anderson: I've not made my peace with seeing a psykolog, but dan (bro) spelt some things out for me.

22/08/2023, 09:41 - Lindsay Walker: Ah, I thought you had had some weeks there
22/08/2023, 09:42 - AJ Anderson: Don't think I've anything other than definitely visit stone town and do the markets which still have loads of spices and talk to a fishman, cos they'll often take you for sunset cruise for a small fee. Better than the tourist cruises
22/08/2023, 09:43 - AJ Anderson: No Dar. Only visited zanzib briefly with Ester
22/08/2023, 09:43 - Lindsay Walker: Ah. Thanks mate, appreciated

20/09/2023, 10:42 - AJ Anderson: i was heartned when he said my sentiment was prev recognised.... but recognised by a comedian it turns out.🤦‍♂️
20/09/2023, 11:19 - AJ Anderson: Will you call me sometime
20/09/2023, 11:50 - Lindsay Walker: Yes, tonight?
20/09/2023, 12:19 - AJ Anderson: Sure

20/09/2023, 21:29 - AJ Anderson: Hey linds. I feel like I'll turn in before that. Not really sleeping again. But it's OK, just next time you're on a train or whatnot
20/09/2023, 21:37 - Lindsay Walker: Tomorrow early?

Longine master collection
22/09/2023, 20:01 - Lindsay Walker: Probably is just the price apparently.
22/09/2023, 23:18 - Lindsay Walker: Looks like it was a great match too :(
23/09/2023, 06:33 - AJ Anderson: 😂Yeah. Well... Until the last min of added time anyway.
23/09/2023, 06:34 - AJ Anderson: was the same in the final couple months back, they play reactive and just switch off when theyre tired
28/09/2023, 11:47 - AJ Anderson: It's a the physiotherapist lindsay. A privileged indulgence. We are go each week not because we're making progress but because it's a nice little massage.
28/09/2023, 11:47 - AJ Anderson: We like the idea of outsourcing the personal responsibility for ones life.
28/09/2023, 11:48 - Lindsay Walker: There are things we can't do by ourselves
28/09/2023, 11:52 - AJ Anderson: It's prostitution because after you've been seen to then you're no longer her problem. These people are in a caring profession but come 5pm on Fri the rules of personal responsibility resume. They're not your people. Which is fine unless the source of your problem is not having people in which case it's cyclic.
28/09/2023, 11:57 - AJ Anderson: Yeah like massaging my bum.  But really it's just nice. Really the answer is 'stop sitting all day'. Just tell me the answer no?
28/09/2023, 12:03 - Lindsay Walker: Like a GP. Or a personal trainer. People shouldn't have coaches?

30/09/2023, 15:24 - AJ Anderson: It's a social coach or a dating coach or some such in that case.
30/09/2023, 15:27 - AJ Anderson: He asked my measures of success of this. I'm looking for pointing out of logical fallacy, a reframing of the situation that gives room for hope or some hard truths.  But these aren't forthcoming
30/09/2023, 15:28 - AJ Anderson: It's been investigative... or rather me telling him at length every little thing.
30/09/2023, 15:29 - AJ Anderson: A process that could have been a whole lot cheaper if I could have written a discertstion and have him study it ahead of time
30/09/2023, 15:29 - Lindsay Walker: Yeah, that is a good basis for other stuff

17/10/2023, 19:55 - AJ Anderson: im in touch with your dad about trying to get back either last weekend of oct or first weekend of nov.  what have you got on those weekends.
17/10/2023, 19:55 - AJ Anderson: ...prob the second one.]
17/10/2023, 19:55 - Lindsay Walker: Are any airports other than Goteberg good?
17/10/2023, 19:58 - AJ Anderson: im told oslo and copenhagen are both viable but never done it, theres 2-3 bus from each which apparently is fairly affordable.... but itd have to be decent price diff.  ryan air do the edi direct on certain days, never great times, but you cant beat it on price (certainly the edi->got direction...dont know why its sometimes way more back the way)
17/10/2023, 20:12 - Lindsay Walker: Yeah, just need to work out a bag size that would work
18/10/2023, 20:52 - Lindsay Walker: As in, do I need to pay for a cabin bag, as it radically changes the costs, which might make other options comparable
22/10/2023, 13:17 - AJ Anderson: planning to be in Scotland weekend after next.  would be nice to catch you some point if not saturday evening at Barrie & Allisons
22/10/2023, 13:30 - Lindsay Walker: Rugby? Edinburgh playing at 5 on Sat. Could eat after / you could stay at ours if you wanted?
22/10/2023, 13:31 - AJ Anderson: i like all these ideas. i thought i looked at edinburgh fixtures and thought it was leinster away that weekend.
22/10/2023, 13:31 - AJ Anderson: 3-6th nov

29/03/2024, 19:48 - Lindsay Walker: What are your transport options out there? If looking at spas, should they be in Goteborg, is the countryside easy?

23/04/2024, 09:26 - AJ Anderson: morning linds!  heres some tips...
23/04/2024, 09:29 - AJ Anderson: 1. the coffee grinders not so difficult, you put the beans in push the button then pour it through th v60 filter (in the dishwasher)
2. alternatively,  *cederleuf* in one stop towards town on the tram is a bakery which does you a ok coffee and a bun.
3. if you're headed into town before coffee then definitely get yourself to one of the *dematteo* 's.  Verry good coffee and kardemumebulle. <This message was edited>
23/04/2024, 09:29 - AJ Anderson: the vastrafik app (ToGo) is very good.  for trip planning and live departures, sure you'll figure that one out
23/04/2024, 09:30 - AJ Anderson: tram stop is just a couple mins away
23/04/2024, 09:32 - AJ Anderson: So if you fancy heading up this way for lunch the you're aiming for *säve flygplatts* for 12ish. The car is here and we can drive into nearby town and get proper sit down lunch + pick up some tasty beers (Cami's given me a cool box and some ice, and we can get them nice and chilled in good time)
23/04/2024, 09:33 - AJ Anderson: The only thing ive forgotten to bring is some swimmies,  if you culd grab me a pair of blak shorts from second drawer in the bedroom that would be great.
23/04/2024, 09:33 - AJ Anderson: keys and a battery pack are on the coffee table
23/04/2024, 09:35 - AJ Anderson: if you use link below, you can borrow my tram ticket which'll save a few quid... you can get on any bus/tram/ferry all day <This message was edited>

23/04/2024, 11:06 - AJ Anderson: Well it's no prob because I get you from where ever you happen to be at 12. I say aim for a 'svart' bus from nordstan getting off at skra bro

30/08/2024, 12:29 - AJ Anderson: Yeah thought there might be. Bet it's gorgeous tho. And quiet too.
30/08/2024, 12:29 - AJ Anderson: Bit of a wind up there tho
30/08/2024, 12:31 - Lindsay Walker: Yeah, some breeze here. One couple was just leaving as I got here and there is one other person that I've seen, super quiet
30/08/2024, 12:33 - AJ Anderson: Did I snap the right place?

Front seat of the bus today linds. Thinking about you a lot recently. Hope you're well
13/09/2024, 08:17 - Lindsay Walker: Nice view! Thanks and likewise. I'm doing ok, things with Meg have felt a bit better, which is good, although not an enormous change obvs. Booked another kareoke night, which will be great.

How are you?
14/09/2024, 13:24 - AJ Anderson: Yeah not great.
14/09/2024, 13:25 - AJ Anderson: not sure where to go from here.
14/09/2024, 13:29 - AJ Anderson: ...fed up of the dishwasher. 😒
14/09/2024, 13:29 - AJ Anderson: and you kinda have to hide it all, because its unattractive.
14/09/2024, 13:31 - AJ Anderson: ive started writing about all these things.  I use obsidian, finally found a notetaking app that lets me keep everything local and link things
14/09/2024, 13:34 - AJ Anderson: its tricky. catch up soon i hope
14/09/2024, 13:45 - Lindsay Walker: Yeah, would be good
16/09/2024, 10:15 - Lindsay Walker: Could give you a bell after work?
16/09/2024, 18:35 - Lindsay Walker: 
16/09/2024, 18:52 - Lindsay Walker: Free for the next 30
16/09/2024, 19:24 - AJ Anderson: shoot
16/09/2024, 19:25 - AJ Anderson: i was eating my tea outside. i guess you're home by now.
16/09/2024, 19:25 - AJ Anderson: next time your on the train with some time to spare. im off the next few days
16/09/2024, 19:51 - Lindsay Walker: K, when will you be up tomorrow?
16/09/2024, 20:23 - AJ Anderson: I have an hour head start on you
16/09/2024, 20:24 - Lindsay Walker: Up at 0845 your time?

18/09/2024, 18:49 - Lindsay Walker: Nice!
20/09/2024, 10:32 - Lindsay Walker: Been thinking about your work and trying to work out which analogy it is more like:

Is it like looking for the right pair of shoes, where you can settle for something that isn't right  and live with blisters, or wait and research and risk not finding them (maybe more applicable with the dirth of size 12s)?

Or is it like saving to buy something vs hoping to win it; winning is certainly possible and it sucks to be saving up again, but that has a higher degree of certainty
20/09/2024, 11:57 - AJ Anderson: 0-0 draw. poor footbal. It's fairly similar to a hearts match I'd say.
20/09/2024, 12:42 - Lindsay Walker: Hearts are awful this season, so sorry to hear that 😂
20/09/2024, 12:42 - Lindsay Walker: Edinburgh Leinster later, which may be crushing...
20/09/2024, 18:50 - AJ Anderson: Think that might need more explaining
21/09/2024, 20:42 - AJ Anderson: 
21/09/2024, 21:21 - Lindsay Walker: Oh, I opened that on my phone, decided it was too small, so I would read on my pc, now I can't
22/09/2024, 07:04 - AJ Anderson: Sorry linds I didn't want a record anywhere. Jus some thoughts on value and suicide. Not reconciling a lot of things we spoke about
22/09/2024, 07:48 - Lindsay Walker: Ok, are you able to resend in the same way and I'll read on the right device?
22/09/2024, 08:51 - AJ Anderson: 21/9 Why is it taboo for me to want to meet and fall in love with a young attractive women. When they tell me downscale my expectations (increase your age range), they are saying 'you're low value and depreciating, take what you can get' - why wont anyone speak that truth as it actually is and if its not a truth, what is the fallacy? In any case, this might have been good advice in a more timely manner when compromise could be mitigated by hard work and appreciation of the good. But having traded this instead for hope of better I'm now beyond hope. I feel disgusting for my desire, though 'honourable' (as we have deem to call it) and though this desire is the same that most all men have/had. If I've missed my chance - I don't want stay around only to empty the dishwasher.

My friend convinced me sign up to the tinder cattle-market again, where my value is cemented in a data-derived valuation of human desirability. put on a shelf alongside all othersI'm a low pick; 'Choose me for a power gradient, a servant or a financial incentive'. In four days i score 0/400. Never reached the opportunity to even exchange chat, ironic because even real life affords you that ( nevertheless a painful metaphor for lack of romantic progress in life; a woman never having been meaningfully acknowledged by friends or family)This is a history I never want reminded of. A losers story with nothing salvageable to take from it. If the door has closed on my only life non-negotiable (family and belonging) i don't think i want this. I'll never judge another for choosing life, but to me I don't see why the hopeless/pathetic continue. Retiring from life is the only true altruism, not through some nobility or honour but simply acknowledgment of irrelevance. When i feel stronger, i feel: 'fuck it - fuck any cunt who presumes to tell me conventions to live by , i'll just do my best and be chosen or not by the great selectors of our species'; cheesy but a biological truth and the reason that non-consent is so repulsive. But other times (like now) its feels like the reality hitting home, a (rapidly) dwindling set of possible outcomes. I don't know what to say, depressive periods are such a waste of time - time that should be spent trying to fix things... but i have for 20 years and now i'm tired. I don't like to see my parents or family or friends, because i have no progress to report for 20 years. 20 fucking years. I've been everywhere, met every type of person, always alone and always actually pointless (no-one was there, theres no account of it). Lindsay, every young woman i see i picture myself with. Im energised and excited by stupidly banal ideas of romance and belonging. And every so often im painfully reminded that they dont look at me the same way (today a young woman almost walked up behind me put her arm round me because she mistook me for her dad). The world is simple Lindsay and I've missed it, i just dont have the balls to steal the chocolate bar.
22/09/2024, 08:55 - AJ Anderson: 22/9, im so tired of it.  I wake in the morning and forget for a moment where i am, like after deep sleep.  But every effort now is just hedging. im angry at the bullshit we propagate, in the face of objective truths and quantifiable data.  I recognise to most, these ideaologies are irrelvant; if you've got meaning and purpose then you dismiss it as a worldview and get on with your life.  But if you dont, there is only the reality that you come alone and you go alone and the only thing that matters is the people in between.  If we dont long for and compete for sexual priority then what is our social hierarchy.  Incel bullshit.  Broadly its only misguidance is the idea that a third party is somehow at fault.  If you're a fucking loser, then its little wonder you score low on tinder.  If you lose because of unwillingness to compromise your hope, then youve bet and lost.  My situation is my fault fed by naive life philipsophies of pre-determinism and a lack of critical thinking and scrutinised truth (who stands up and speaks honest thought to another on matters of the heart).  If I can't stand on my wedding day and say its been worth the wait, then whats to be said for marriage.  And with so much forfeit, mathematically it becomes increasingly unobtainable.
22/09/2024, 09:22 - Lindsay Walker: As you know, I disagree with you about value and desirability for a specific situation being the same thing. You are also obviously right that different world views shape our own senses of value and change how we respond to other people's goals.
22/09/2024, 09:28 - Lindsay Walker: I do think that your stated goals and values have often been at odds with each other and that that contributes to you feeling "low value".

All data would tell you that the most likely middle class  women to be wanting to have children are in their mid thirties, and while you claim that is your only purpose for being, the rest of your  chat doesn't go down that route.
22/09/2024, 09:30 - Lindsay Walker: Of course young women are sexually desirable. I definitely do not think that makes them desirable wives. I think you have a lot of greif for a part of life you feel you missed out on and that leads to incorrect conclusions about how life can be happy now.
22/09/2024, 09:32 - Lindsay Walker: Being able to say it was all worthwhile seems like huge pressure to put on yourself and an illogical position; are you saying that being exceptionally happy at the time, having met a woman you love, but still recognising pain from the past would be insufficient?
22/09/2024, 09:36 - Lindsay Walker: I also don't really beleive that you beleive the value based descriptors, or you would be trying to calibrate "the best I can get with my value", rather than looking for a better relationship (I obviously think the second approach, which you have taken, is better)
22/09/2024, 09:40 - Lindsay Walker: I'm not saying that lonliness, sadness, depression are wrong or easy ways to feel. I still think that getting professional support would be the best way forward (both in terms of your wellbeing and likelihood of finding the relationship you want), although I get that navigating the interaction with your career complicates it
22/09/2024, 09:44 - Lindsay Walker: I'd also point out that your "selectors" chat is bull. You have been "selected" by a number of women and chosen to end the relationship, because these things are mutual. There are lots of women who would choose you that you would reject,  which is always the case on both sides
22/09/2024, 10:24 - AJ Anderson: Presumably it's an reasonable hypothetical. You lay in bed at night, happy and content next to your beloved and you question: Would I do again the loneliness in exchange for this at the end or would I rather taken an earlier opportunity knowing it may not have been as satisfying
22/09/2024, 10:25 - AJ Anderson: Linds this isn't on you but when I journal now often you're the imagined recipient because we talk candidly on this stuff
22/09/2024, 10:30 - Lindsay Walker: My question stands; if your answer is 'all that really sucked, but I am happy now" then how do you quantify  "worth it".
22/09/2024, 10:32 - Lindsay Walker: That implies full choice and control, which none of us have, and that a future relationship has to be so much better than anything before, rather than just good and satisfying; not only happiness, but enough extra happiness to outweigh all previous hurts
22/09/2024, 10:34 - AJ Anderson: But Im not sure I communicate it sufficiently well because you make out like I'm chasing a niave nubile dream, an effort to go back in time to experience all consuming r&j love. But it's not. 28-35 was my range. And sana tells me try 35-43.   And it's not about a reasons for being. It's about what's enough to empty the dishwasher for. Because if it's not enough you will only resent and have tepid relationship unfair on her anyway. Camis a nice woman. But she has no functional family to speak of. No role model or aspiration. What chance she has the capacity for working for a functional family. So its not to say I'm deselected it's to say Ive deselected by the most desirable females. Of course subjective to a certain level but even if we don't all want the same thing from a house we all generally agree on what's a valuable property
22/09/2024, 10:36 - AJ Anderson: True its a time wasting hypothetical. Nobody controls time. But it's the good  memories that see you through hard times.
22/09/2024, 10:44 - AJ Anderson: <Media omitted>
22/09/2024, 10:44 - AJ Anderson: Professional help is the con of age. That I'm almost certain of.  I think lived experience and genuine care trumps the charade of psychotherapy. If it's just talking, then that's what I do in my journal or to you.  And like most all the legacy professions, llms are the average of all training data, lawyers and doctors are only the average of what they've read. But I know we disagree on that

Last night I tried to talk Claude around.👆🥸 <This message was edited>
22/09/2024, 10:49 - AJ Anderson: I had to frame it to avoid the 'guard rails'
22/09/2024, 10:52 - AJ Anderson: I better go. Got a paid gig at storm heliworks today.
22/09/2024, 10:52 - AJ Anderson: I'm thankful for you Lindsay.
22/09/2024, 10:52 - AJ Anderson: Sorry about leinster leinster. I heard they cleaned up
22/09/2024, 10:59 - Lindsay Walker: The match was good, dissapointing but much better than recent years. At least we gor 2 bonis points
22/09/2024, 11:00 - Lindsay Walker: Great! What is it?
22/09/2024, 11:00 - AJ Anderson: Holding tourists hands when they get on the helicopter
22/09/2024, 11:01 - Lindsay Walker: Lol, we do disagree, because it is what I do for a living. Obviously I am biaised towwards beleiving that my job has significance, but I also have both anecdotal and impirecal evidence, alongside lived experience
22/09/2024, 11:02 - Lindsay Walker: A foot on the laadder! Pun intended
22/09/2024, 11:19 - AJ Anderson: I always considered pilot a social status like doctor or lawyer. Something a woman could be proud to tell her father. Now it wreaks of patheticness. Middle aged man trying to right his shortcomings as a youth.
22/09/2024, 11:21 - AJ Anderson: Clawing at lost dreams. Utterly pityable. It's a sorry state linds. If I met me, I'd think loser.
22/09/2024, 11:22 - AJ Anderson: I freq wondered if my dad was a loser. You ever consider? I made my peace with yes but he lived to his values and worked hard for his family. He's still married and with family that love him what more can you asm
22/09/2024, 11:23 - AJ Anderson: Sorry linds is self pitying bullshit this. But I done with it.
22/09/2024, 11:23 - AJ Anderson: Shit or get off the pot
22/09/2024, 11:25 - Lindsay Walker: Pilot is a status to be proad of.
22/09/2024, 12:33 - Lindsay Walker: What would you think about praying about this with me?
23/09/2024, 10:12 - AJ Anderson: Not so comfortable, thanks linds.
23/09/2024, 10:27 - Lindsay Walker: I thought probably not, but wasn't sure given your chat last time
23/09/2024, 19:38 - AJ Anderson: Have you got a few mins for me tonight? Are you playing kirk?
23/09/2024, 21:09 - Lindsay Walker: I do, not playing

I never told you this. But I found this in my mailbox yesterday after we spoke.
25/09/2024, 20:39 - AJ Anderson: mystery where it came from.
25/09/2024, 20:40 - Lindsay Walker: What does it say?
25/09/2024, 20:47 - AJ Anderson: <Media omitted>

06/03/2025, 22:15 - AJ Anderson: Mystery
14/03/2025, 11:09 - AJ Anderson: What exactly did you like about war and peace?
14/03/2025, 11:09 - AJ Anderson: I'm trying again. But I have to start over every time because there's so many chars
14/03/2025, 11:11 - Lindsay Walker: I enjoted the family relationships, the humour of the numerology, the dramas
14/03/2025, 11:11 - AJ Anderson: Just the well crafted story telling, char dev or some greater underlying commentary on something
14/03/2025, 11:11 - AJ Anderson: Numerology. Ok I need look that up.
14/03/2025, 11:12 - AJ Anderson: Humour... Um ok
14/03/2025, 11:12 - Lindsay Walker: The emotion around war
14/03/2025, 11:12 - AJ Anderson: Ok. Give me 6 months
14/03/2025, 11:13 - AJ Anderson: It's like when Paul set me reading the bible in a year. Didn't get past genesis

21/03/2025, 17:26 - AJ Anderson: Will think on ir
21/03/2025, 23:32 - Lindsay Walker: https://holiday.holidaypirates.com/holidays/?destinationIds=214&departureAirports=EDI&nights=4&rooms=2&date=2025-04-28&flexibility=5&sort=POPULAR#hotelUrl=%2Fholidays%2Fgermany%2Fberlin%2Fpark-inn-by-radisson-berlin-alexanderplatz.html
23/03/2025, 22:38 - AJ Anderson: Always wanted to go Berlin
23/03/2025, 22:40 - Lindsay Walker: Me too, although now I've been looking at islands / Albania / Croatia too
23/03/2025, 22:41 - AJ Anderson: Also on my list by coincidence... for two reasons: 2025 Sailing trip, and helicopter work
25/03/2025, 00:11 - Lindsay Walker: What's the thinking at this stage? I need to probably book my time off this week, fairly flexible in May
25/03/2025, 10:38 - AJ Anderson: Could be keen on berlin for a 1/2 nighter. further afield prob not unless i was working down there, or interviews, so harder to plan for.
25/03/2025, 10:38 - AJ Anderson: no job still, so trying to be bit savvy
25/03/2025, 10:41 - Lindsay Walker: Aye, get that
25/03/2025, 10:41 - Lindsay Walker: How are you doing?
28/03/2025, 11:56 - Lindsay Walker: In terms of Berlinning, if you can cope with my snoring, we could share a twin room. No difference price wise for me compared to going alone, so you would only need flights. In those circs, would 3 / 4 nights work?

Was looking at c. 28 April.
31/03/2025, 10:32 - AJ Anderson: sorry linds, i only hesitate because everything is in the air, it just seems to be nature of my life... but when its a pattern this long, it means im probably the factor
31/03/2025, 10:36 - Lindsay Walker: At least you chose a good career for everything being in the air
31/03/2025, 10:36 - AJ Anderson: what were your date factors.
31/03/2025, 10:37 - AJ Anderson: window, weekend vs weekday prefs, etc
31/03/2025, 10:38 - AJ Anderson: just a escape for a couple days? or does need align with family etc
31/03/2025, 10:39 - Lindsay Walker: Any time 26 Apr to 1 May 😂
31/03/2025, 10:39 - Lindsay Walker: Just a fun trip
31/03/2025, 20:42 - Lindsay Walker: 598th game of kirk for me tonight...
31/03/2025, 21:07 - AJ Anderson: Wow. Take a few weeks off so I can come for the big 600!😂
31/03/2025, 23:49 - Lindsay Walker: How goes job hunting?
01/04/2025, 21:12 - Lindsay Walker: Sorry for pestering, but looking to book something for the end of the month. Happy to go to Berlin or Amsterdam, or other suggestions. Happy to call and discuss it later on if that would be good; would also just be nice to chat!
01/04/2025, 21:42 - AJ Anderson: Not at all! Linds I hate always being so slow to commit. Ok is no 1 agenda point for tomorrow.  If you're free I'll call if not I'll text with suggestions
01/04/2025, 22:01 - Lindsay Walker: Call for tomorrow rather than later today? That's fine, just clarifying
01/04/2025, 22:15 - AJ Anderson: Tomo 🙏
01/04/2025, 22:24 - Lindsay Walker: Grand, early or late bbetter?
02/04/2025, 09:54 - AJ Anderson: working no.  Doing more cold calling till midday. after that perhaps
02/04/2025, 18:44 - Lindsay Walker:
